Exaltation and Debilitation of Planets
Based on Moon Sign

Every planet has a positive and negative placement. For instance, a well-placed planet, or an exalted planet can lead you to great achievements in life. At the same time, a debilitated planet in a weak position can cause you to go through a rough and challenging phase.



   Exalted Planets signify strength and happiness by being placed in that friendly zodiac sign, like when you are at your home and there’s something special about that one corner, which attracts you always to spend your time there. You also get new innovative ide
   as while the spark of creativity will ignite your mind when resting in that corner",


The tough time in your life: Debilitation of Planets
Due to your busy schedule, you were not able to clean your garden and the room that got messed because of the last party night. Now, you are struggling while cleaning that alone and are exhausted with the burden of work related to that room or the corner. All these scenarios will be faced by planets as well, where the planet gets placed in such a zodiac sign, that it gets tired and loses its strength. This form of placements is known as debilitation in Vedic Astrology.

If you have debilitated Planets in your birth chart, you will face struggles related to the significance of those Planets.

  ". Sun (Surya): The Celestial KingAdd commentMore actions

It is said that the Sun is the soul of the planets. It is vital, respectable, authoritative, and has many other great attributes. Sun will demonstrate how an individual reflects themselves onto the world.



Astrologically speaking, a strong Sun denotes authority and vitality, but a weak Sun can indicate egotism and a lack of self-assurance. When it involves your professional life, you might require a powerful Sun, but not when it relates to your personal connections.



It symbolizes



the Kshatriya caste,

the vice planet,

the Sattva guna,

the Pitta nature,

and the fire component.

According to astrology, the Sun governs the



head,

bones,

eyes,

heart,

and brain.

2. Moon (Chandra): The Nurturer

In the navagraha, the Moon stands for our psyche. It is recognised for having a maternal influence on people and for granting feelings of love, happiness, and positivity. Since the Moon represents the self in a kundli, its strength will benefit you at every stage of life.



However, mental health issues like



stress,

depression,

disinterest, etc,

can be brought on by a weak Moon.



Astrologically, the Moon is a member of the Vaisya (business-class) caste. It symbolizes



ladies,

Vata-Kapha nature and

sattva Guna.

You must wear white more often if the Moon is weak in your kundli. According to astrology, the Moon governs the



mind,

mother,

art,

vision,

saliva,

lungs,

silver,

rice,

and the chest.

3. Mars (Mangal): The Warrior Planet

According to astrology, Mars stands for boldness, strength, confidence, bravery, and passion. You can succeed in your work and any other professional effort if your kundli has a strong Mars. An unfriendly Mars, however, is harmful to your marriage.



Mars is a member of the element fire. The planet is associated with the



Tamo-guna class of warriors (Kshatriyas),

Pitta nature,

cruelty and aggression,

and a preference for red.

In astrology, Mars is in charge of the following:



siblings,

arms,

thieves,

wounds,

daal,

pitta,

blood,

muscles,

hearing,

nose, etc.

Mercury is the planet of the mother's brother and skin and sex-related illnesses. Additionally, it stands for



trade,

mathematics,

speech,

tongues,

voice,

dumbness,

and sloth.

5. Venus (Shukra): The Aesthetic Planet

Venus is the astrological symbol for love, relationships, romance, having sex, and other such characteristics. It also affects a person's marriage and business relationships with partners.



Consequently, a strong Venus in the kundli promotes a successful career. In contrast, a weak Venus controls troubled relationships and love life. Venus is a stunning woman who is a member of the Brahmin caste. It stands for the Rajoguni, Kapha, charm, and lament of the water.



White is the color of Venus and is associated with



beauty,

marriage,

love,

sex,

blissful marriage,

poetry,

singing,

eyes, and ladies, among other things.

6. Jupiter (Brihaspati): The Giant Benevolent

Of the 9 planets of astrology, one of the most advantageous planets is Jupiter. It can support you in a variety of pursuits, particularly in terms of learning new things. Jupiter supports a person's academic and professional success. Jupiter, thus, has little impact on a person's early years.



The planet stands for both the space component and the Brahmin caste. It represents the nature of Sattva Guna and Kapha. Yellow is the color that symbolizes Jupiter. Jupiter also represents



the Vedas,

the Sun,

education,

kidney,

fat,

a tall, slender body,

8. Rahu: The Materialistic Planet

Rahu is a planet associated with various symbolic meanings, but it also depicts human wants and manipulation. The formless shadow planet is called Rahu. If a person falls into the Rahu's trap, it is known to make them addicted, avaricious, and full of bad energy. If you succumb to its unknowable greed, you will have to face Rahu's wrath.



Rahu is the Vice Planet for the natures of Chandaal, Tamoguni, and Vaat Pitta. It denotes the use of dark colors. Rahu also represents



the grandpa,

the granny,

deceit,

mishap,

fight,

stealing,

snakebite,

overseas travel,

illnesses relating to the skin and legs,

and challenging life advancement.

In astrology, Ketu represents both spirituality and detachment. Aside from Rahu, Ketu is the second shadow planet in astrology. It is well known that Ketu satisfies materialistic cravings, but only for personal benefit.



Ketu's adverse effects can either make a person ungrateful for material things or drive them away from commonplace and worldly goals. Astrologically speaking, Ketu is similar to Mars.

D10 Chart Analysis in Vedic Astrology
When a horoscope is in the 12th house, there is confusion in one’s profession. In the Dasha or antardasha times of planets in Kendra houses or the rulers of the Kendra houses of the D-10 map, favourable outcomes or career advancements are promised. It is also critical to examine the role of the 10th lord of the D-1 map in the D-10 chart.

In Dasamsa Chart Analysis, the first home or Lagna of the D10 map represents our intent or ability to practise Karmas. If the D10 Chart ascendant Lord becomes frail, the entire map suffers. The position of the planets in the first house of the D10 map has a significant impact on our work or professional life. It will shape the career following its importance.

The second house is all about communication, family, and resources, among other things. The second house also represents our ethics or the kind of job we do. If you have evil planets in your second homes, such as Rahu or Saturn, you will do work that is not permissible in society. However, if you have Planets such as Jupiter or Venus, you cannot do such practice jobs unless you are incapable of doing so. It will illustrate your family’s support of your practice, as well as the people who support your work.

Courage, short trip, change, and so on are all associated with the third house. The third house is associated with job transfers, job changes, and travel. The third house also represents the writing capacity, whether the third house or third Lord is well placed in the D10 table or good conjunction with the tenth house or tenth lord. And others work in the writing industry, such as poets, authors, and editors.

Happiness rules the fourth house. How pleased you are with your job. The fourth house reflects your professional portrait. If your 4th house has an unafflicted and powerful Moon, Jupiter, and Venus, it is very beneficial to your appearance and reputation at work.

In the D10 map, the 5th house represents our assistants, creative works, and intelligence. The sixth house is the house of Work, Enemy, Obstacles, Appropriate Job, and Challenges. If the 6th house contains malefic planets such as the Sun, Mars, or Saturn, it is very favourable. It will assist you in overcoming obstacles and difficulties.

The 7th house represents the house of business. If your 7th house is high in your D10 chart or is linked to the 10th Lord, it will lead you to market. A solid 7th house in a D10 chart will bring business, while a solid 6th house will bring a Job. Often individuals are seen coming into business after leaving their employment. Their 6th and 7th houses are both substantial. The seventh house is the fourth house from the fourth. If you have benefic planets in your 7th family, it is fantastic for your prestige at work, travel, and so on.

The eighth house is the most mysterious. The 8th house is the house with Surprises, Delays, Obstacles, and other Negative Stuff. However, keep in mind that the 8th house is the 11th from the 10th house, and the 8th house in the D10 map shows the kind of delays and transformation you will face. If it is solid or well-disposed, it will also provide you with a sudden boost in your professional life. The third or eighth house often indicates a brief break from your work or career.

The 9th house in the D10 chart represents your luck or fortune, as well as your manager or higher authority. If the D10 Lagna Lord is installed in the 9th house. Most of the time, they are self-employed and do not choose to work with others.

The 11th house represents the house of Gain and social circle. It also describes your achievement, financial advantage, and assistance from your social network or relatives. The 12th house represents a loss. It also denotes a foreign nation.
If the 12th Lord is in conjunction with the 10th Lord in the 10th family, the 1st Lord of the Lagna Lord, it will provide you with a career in a foreign country and financial advantage from your foreign connections. So, these are the positions of the 12th buildings, which vary somewhat from D1.

Placements Of Planet In The D10 Chart
Sun In 10th House In D10 Chart
Let us begin with the Sun. If the Sun is in your tenth house, this is a good omen, or the 10th Lord is with the Sun, you should consider a career as an administrator, IAS, or IPS, or other government job or leadership position. Medicine, politics, and some music-related work would all be beneficial.

Moon In The 10th House In D10 Chart
If you have Moon in 10th House, and you have a career in hotel administration, human resources, nursing, social activities, or state government. The work would be satisfactory. Engineering, Police, Administration, Army, and Navy would be helpful if Mars exists. If Mars and Mercury are aligned, you will be drawn to a career in accounting, for instance, a cost accountant or a chartered accountant.

Mercury In The 10th House In D10 Chart
Mercury represents writers, editor, publisher, lawyer, information management, journalist, marketing executive, etc. There is a contrast being made between ads and sales. Moon is mainly associated with sales-related jobs. Mercury, on the other hand, represents advertisement works. If Jupiter is present, careers in lectureship, teaching, and religious guru would be advantageous. Jupiter bestows every Noble profession with a high level of distinction.

Venus In The 10th House In D10 Chart
If you have Venus, you can pursue careers in modelling, acting, singing, dancing, finance, automobiles, graphic design, and fashion design. If Venus connects with Mars, the signal for fashion and graphic design would be more robust. If you are close to the Sun, it will lead you to a career in medicine. If Saturn resides in your tenth house, you can choose a career in business administration, as a judge or lawyer, or in the mining or agricultural fields.

Rahu represents occupations such as photographer, film producer, film director, editing, human resources, etc. Rahu plays an indirect role in acting. Venus has a significant effect. If Rahu has a link to that, it would be beneficial to the media and performing.

If Ketu is present, careers in pharmacy, research, mathematics, electronics, or computer science would be advantageous. When Ketu conjuncts Venus, it will bring about a promising career in consulting. If paired with Mars, this is beneficial to Pharma, Medical Representatives, Doctors, and others. When paired with Jupiter, it is excellent for being a Guru or coach.

The Placement Of 10th Lord In The House In D10 Chart
We would know the real profession after doing permutations and combinations of these three. If the 10th Lord is in the 1st house or blends with the 1st Lord, you will achieve great success in your profession by your efforts. It’s a fantastic pairing. You will obtain a high-ranking government role. You can’t work with someone for too long. These individuals begin their careers with a job, but later on, they will pursue their own company or self-employment.

If the 10th Lord resides in the 2nd house, you will have the blessing of your kin. Your listening and speaking abilities would be essential in your career. Sales, marketing, and teaching are also viable options. If it is in the third building, you can change jobs sometimes or work in a transferable position where the place can change. You can work in jobs that need a lot of travel, such as sales.

You should pick a hardworking career because the third house often represents courage and physical labour. The third chamber rules writing. So, you have the option of being a writer, editor, or journalist, among other professions. The fourth house is all about education and home country. If the 10th Lord rests in the 4th family, your occupation will be focused primarily on your native land or locations. Professions of education, research, and so on would be suitable for you. The 10th Lord will aspect the 10th house in this role. The likelihood of success would improve. You have a strong sense of leadership and an authoritative demeanour.

The fifth house is all about our intellect and creative abilities. Work in research, lecturing, technology, singing, dancing and acting would be appropriate. However, you may not be assuaged with your job, or you may be able to change jobs. If the 10th Lord resides in the 6th place, you have a good chance of beginning your career with an appointment. You would benefit from service-oriented jobs. Medicine, banking, law, and the judiciary would be beneficial to you.`,
,
`The 10th Lord in the 7th house is a suitable combination for beginning your own company or working for yourself. It’s a healthy mix of industry and collaboration. The 10th Lord in the 8th house will cause you to be delayed in achieving success. After a long period of resistance. You will pursue a career in research, science, medicine, detective work, and espionage.

The 10th Lord in the 9th house is an excellent combination. It denotes a great deal of achievement in one’s professional life. Guru, or higher wisdom, is represented by the 9th Lord. Teaching, lectureship, and professorship in college or university, research scholar, religious guru, and spiritual guru are all promising professions for you. Your father is significant to your career development.

One of the most vital roles is the 10th Lord in the 10th tower. Every kind of job where you can demonstrate your Authority would be beneficial to you. A business strategy, politics, administration, and project management can be helpful to you. You will be born with innate leadership skills and talents. Professions related to finance, money, social events, and so on would benefit if the 10th Lord is in the 11th house. If the 10th Lord is in the 12th building, you can pursue professions such as medicine, nursing, charitable service, and social events. You can choose all of them.

So, these are the outcomes of the 10th Lord’s placing in the 12th house. We can also look at the D1 map, which has planets in the 10th house. The worlds with the most sway will represent the occupation. In certain instances, I also support Jaimini. Amatyakaraka is the giant planet for a career in Jaimini astrology. The Amatyakaraka planet’s position in the D10 map should also be observed. The sign and earth must be examined. The Dash you’re going through is also significant.

Planets that are important in determining a career in astrology
The ruling and placement in the 10th house are relevant indicators for choosing the correct occupation. Though the tenth house is the most important for deciding a future career, it is not the only important house for determining a profession.

The Navamsa occupied by the 10th Lord plays a significant part. In addition to the 10th building, the 2nd, 11th, and 9th houses should be considered. When researching the native’s occupation, these houses are not to be overlooked.

If the outcomes of the more potent planets are intelligently blended, it will expose the most appropriate career. As a result, we recommend that the ascendant test the 10th, 2nd, 11th, and 9th houses.

The study of your Dasamsa chart’s various houses will help you get a clear view of your occupation and profession. The following is a summary of each house in the D10 chart:

First House: It is related to the renown you may obtain as a result of your work.
Second House: It is concerned with investment and the origins of investment.
Third House: It is all about making deals and communicating.

The fourth house indicates your office property and company properties.
Fifth House: It is associated with company growth and the hiring of new workers.
Sixth Home: This is the house of rivalry, chance, and relationships with coworkers.

It is all about public affairs in the Seventh House.
Seventh House: It is all about public affairs in the
The eighth house: It is associated with corporate loans and debts.
The ninth house: It represents the possibility of corporate and professional travel.
The tenth house is the most critical because it represents your earning ability and managerial abilities.
Eleventh Home: This is the house of professional gains and associates.

The Twelfth House represents your hidden foes. In your company and profession, it is the house of loss.

How D10 Chart Prediction Helps
While considering Career Astrology, we must consider the house and house-lord who have an impact on the 10th house of occupation. It is a fundamental assumption that the Lord of the house, who represents the tasks or function associated with a particular profession, would play a prominent role.

The 6th house and its Lord should also control the profession of police officers since the 6th house controls disorder, robbers, plague, loan, and lawsuits, among other things. Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter are the primary and secondary astrologers for police work.

Similarly, in addition to the 10th and other chambers, the 5th house should be studied for legal professions because the career of advocates and judges needs vital argumentative skill and brain application. The 5th house and its owner would influence diplomacy, imagination, coercion, and other such occupations.

The 8th house is concerned because having influence over many individuals or tasks is part of the role. The 8th house and its Lord are significant in the horoscopes of IAS, architects, MBAs, politicians, and others.

If service is indicated, the 6th house must influence the native’s occupation. If government service is mentioned, the influence of either the Sun or Moon on the 6th house or its Lord will almost definitely be present. The 10th lord, for example, may occupy the 6th house in Cancer or Leo, or the 6th lord may be put in the 10th house and receive the Navamsa, or constellation, of the Sun or Moon.

Before declaring the ultimate result of every part of life, the Navamsa chart must be considered. It is a great injustice to the native if the navamsa map is not given due consideration. Lords of the 10th, 2nd, and 11th houses in the Navamsa would be very helpful in determining your occupation. You will read more about using the Navamsa or D9 map in our detailed article.

Aside from Navamsa, the constellations are significant in every research to decide how to know a career. Each of the 27 constellations has its meaning. In comparison, the Atmakaraka and Amatyakaraka planets are very helpful in determining one’s occupation. Both of these elements should be intelligently combined. These are the celestial indicators for a person’s profession, employment, or trade.

are given (see Fig-14) `,






`The meaning of slokas in Fig-14 are as follows:
“KHAVEDAMSA (D40): (1/40th part of a sign), for odd signs
count from Aries and for an even sign from Libra in respect of
Chatvarimsamsa (each of 45' of arc). Vishnu, Chandra,
Marichi, Tvashta, Dhata, Siva, Ravi, Yama,Yaksha,
Gandharva, K ala and Varuna repeat successively as per
presiding deities in the same order for all sings.”

The meaning of slokas in Fig-15 are as follows:
“AKSHAVEDHAMSA (D45): (1/45th part of a sign), Aries,
Leo and Sagittarius re the signs from which the distributions
respectively commence for movable, immovable and common
signs. In movable signs, Brahma, Siva and Vishnu; in
immovable sings Siva, Vishnu and Brahma and in common
sings Vishnu, Brahma and Siva repeat 15 times the
presidentship over these Akshavedamsas”
In Brihat Parasara Hora Sastra [16]
, Chapter 6 (“The Sixteen
Divisions of a Sign”) on Page 79, the meaning of slokas 33-41
are given (see Fig-16):
The meaning of slokas in Fig-16 are as follows:
“SHASHTIAMSA (D60): (1/60th part a of sign or half a
degree each): To calculate the Shashtiamsa lord, ignore the
sign position of a planet and take the degrees etc. it traversed
in that sign. Multiply that figure by 2 and divide the degree by
12. Add 1 to the remainder which will indicate the sign in
which the Shashtiamsa falls. The lord of that sign is the planet
ruling the said Shashtiamsa. In odd signs, the names of
Shashtiamsa are: l. Ghora, 2. Rakshasa, 3. Deva, 4. Kubera, 5.
Yaksha, 6. Kinnara, 7. Bhrashta, 8. Kulaghna, 9. Garala, 10.

Notes
(1) For Gemini (*), Mercury is the lord as per Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra [16]
, but at the time of Lord Sri Rama’s birth, Mercury [13] didn’t
exist, so the lordship of Gemini existed with Moon (*).
(2) For Virgo (**), Mercury is the lord as per Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra [16]
, but at the time of Lord Sri Rama’s birth, Mercury [13] didn’t
exist, so the lordship of Virgo existed with Sun (**).

`D60 chart is a shastiamsha divisional chart of very big 60 divisional of a sign. So one can think fraction of thirteen it is so deep. Here so many secrets can be revealed by D60 . We get to know how we will get.

Shastiamsha is a past life we see the past life karma that the person is having any curse or not , also we can see clue for present life from it, what the person life will be. Also it is a sanchit karma what is to be faced in the life, during the journey of a life what a native has to be faced. So everything is covered in d60. Past life deeds whether the curse or blessing , clue for present life what you do so that easy you get in this life as well as what is to be faced in the life that is a sanchit karma. These 3 things has to be seen.

The twins chart here in this d60 chart gets seperated even though they are born in difference 30 sec, 1 minute this chart gets seperated and because of this difference both the life gets difference. So the twins chart can be identified clearly by this chart difference by 2 minutes as ascendent changes diety changes. Every d60 ascendent in d60 has one deity goddess, god so accordingly it runs. D60 represents yourself and how the past life has affected this life. It says that d60 lagna represents so many things. D60 lagna represent yourself and how is your past life affects this life.

• D60 shows the karma from bhava where the planet or planets afflicted or conjucted or aspected.
• It shows the karma from bhava where the planets are afflicted or conjuncted or aspected. How many planets are afflicted or how many other aspects are there that denotes this.
• If D60 beneficial planet should be aspected by malefic planet and more than the 2 planets malefic aspecting balancing planets. So its like how it is been placed it shows the curse.
• If benefic planet of d60 should be aspect by malefic planet in your d60 chart thats only aspect allowed.
• If more than 2 malefic planets are aspecting benefic planet then you have a curse. Either the ascendent lord of your ascendent or ascendent lord of your D60.

D40 is a maternal curse getting curse from maternal family, mother family.
D45 is the paternal curse from the ancestor of parents father, father line you might be getting any curse. D60 means your own curse, you accumulated such a deeds because of which you are getting curse so its your own deeds.
D60 also shows the traits in this life. Past loves karma and manifest in D60. It can be manifest in D60 .

How the past life karma is there?

Past life can be seen from the arudha lagna in d60 . You can take the arudha lagna as lagna in d60 from that arudha lagna you can see past life of that person. Mula dasha is also calculated according to this. Mula dasha is very powerful dasha it is to be shown in D60 chart. Especially who are interested in past life deeds they must see the mula dasha. Mula dasha is also some kind of planetary position where the person can see his past life deeds and accordingly interepretation one can be seen that how what kind of a things person has been done.
D60 can also connect to dharma what kind of religious beliefs do you have is also to be seen. We all know that 9th house is a dharma house. So we should see 9th lord of d1 chart is places in which amsha in d60 chart. That means that bad karma is the cause of your birth in this life. Because of that reason you have taken birth.

• The first house in d60 chart , ascendent lord of D60 chart , planets placed in first house of d60 chart and planet aspecting in first house of d60, that deity of d60 decides your past karma. This is also one theory of seeing past karma.
• If there is no planet in D60 ascendent, no planet is also not aspecting it, then life will be free from any encumbrance of past life so you are not suffering because of past life. You are not influence of past life deeds.
• If the first house lord or ascendent lord of D60 is malefic like sun, mars , saturn it is malefic. If your ascendent lord of D60 is jupiter, venus , moon, mercury that means your life is smooth
• If you are born in sun , mars , saturn ascendent lord in D60 chart that means you are going to have a slow growth in your life and always cause a delay, because of your certain deeds in past life. Because of your own deeds of past life you are not able to get that good peace , good speed in this life.
• If your ascendent lord in D60 chart is jupiter, mercury , moon and venus then this life will be smooth.

Now first house lord placed in which house in D60 chart?
• If your ascendent lord of d60 placed in 1 or 5 or 9 houses trikona houses it means you are devotee and because of good devotion you got this life.
• If your ascendent lord of d60 is placed in 2, 6 and 10 houses you are materialistic, you are born because of material pleasures to enjoy.
• If your ascendent lord of d60 is placed in 3, 7 and 11 house then your life is ariticial life, illusory life. You know all the film stars or many people living artificial life. May be people get inspired by you but you yourself beleive in your living as artificial life.
• If your ascendent lord if d60 is placed in 4th , 8th or 12th house then you are a moksha karaka, you're taken last birth in this life then after you will be having a moksha.
• Then you have to see the 9th house . If 9th house of your D60 is damaged that means there is a struggle in this life. And not blessed by anyone and this life will be very very tough for you.
• 6 , 8 and 12 houses are also very important in D60 chart. You have to see those 6 , 8 , 12 houses which planets place and who are their lords with which they associated with them they creates misfortune. So you have to see lords of 6th, 8th ,12th houses which planets they are, which planet is seated in these houses, and which planets they are conjuncted with.

`Key Points:
1. Concept of Hora:
a. Weekdays, Sunday (Su), Monday (Mo), Tuesday (Ma),
Wednesday (Me), Thursday (Ju), Friday (Ve), Saturday (Sa).
b. What is the logic behind this order? ->HORA is the reason,
there are 24 horas. First hora of the day starts at sunrise.
2. Brahma Gayatri (sunrise), Vishnu’s or Achyuta’s time (noon),
Siva gayatri (sunset), Kali gayatri (not auspicious).
3. Distance from sun, speed w.r.t. to earth, the rule used for
allocating houses to planets. (Sa is slowest).
4. Hindus consider 1day starting from one Sunrise to the next.
5. Astronomical fact is, Sa is slowest (takes 2.5yrs to move one
sign, or 30yrs), Ju (takes 1yrs to move one rasi OR 12 yrs), Ma
(1.5yrs), Su (1yr), Ve and Me and Mo - This is the order.
6. For Saturday, the horas starting with Sa will be Sa, Ju, Ma, Su,
Ve, Me. Mo. This makes one cycle of 7 hours, so for one day (of
24hrs or horas), there will be three cycles followed by (24-21=3
horas of) Sa, Ju, Ma - Next day begins with Sun's HORA
(Hence, the day after Saturday is Sunday) and so and so forth.
7. This is what Narasimha knows about an explanation for a Day
consisting 24horas -> 12 rasis - one for day and one for night,
hence, there are 24 hours. HORA is taken from AHORATRA,
AHO is Day, and RATRA is night.
8. Four houses are considered base of Purusharthas. 1, 10, 7 and
4 are bases of the DHARMA, ARTHA, KAMA and MOKSHA
purusharthas.
9. DIGBALA - how close a planet is close to the base? (one of the
strengths relate to a planet).
10. Me and Ju are planets of dharma, Sa is planet of Kama, Su and
Ma are planets of Artha and Mo and Ve are planets of Moksha
depending on how far away they are to a base, they are
accordingly given strength. This planet association is used to
compute “shadbalas” other strengths, which will be detailed in
future classes.
11. Civil Calendar is Sun’s calendar.
12. Indian Solar calendar: Su enters Aries, MESHA masa. Su enters
Vrishaba, vrishabha masa. Original Solar calendar, each month
has 30 days.

`Key Points:
Mantra Sastra:
1. Krishna is not only a significator for marriage and he is also for
Learning. “Kleem krishnaya namah” – Krishna sits in 9th house of
Guru.
2. Siva and Parvati are the natural karakas for marriage – when
they are in the 7th house they can give marriage. Ex: “Namah
Sivayai cha Nama Sivaya” 11 letters, 3 words – Siva and Parvati
in 7th house bless the marriage. These are very effective, but are
not from a particular Veda.
3. For specific Mantras from Vedas, it is a good idea to pray to the
Guru who gave that Mantra or to the Rishi of that mantra before
reciting them. Ex. Vishwamitra is the Rishi for Rigveda mantra
“Vrishabam Charsha….”
Chart Analysis:
4. Each house signifies several matters –relevant house for that
matter is seen from that house in the corresponding divisional
chart. Ex 4th house stands for several things like mother,
education, comfort, heart, real estate etc, so for education see
4th house in D-24, for mother see 4th house in D-12 etc. 4th in
Rasi chart shows heart.
5. In any chart note the following in that order in seeing charts
a. First find the divisional chart that we want to see.
b. Then see the house that we are interested in. For ex. to
see the learning of Jyotisha, see 8th house in D-24. 4th
shows general education.
c. Who owns (lord of) that house? The planet is the boss
for that aspect. This planet can set the rules for that
house.

When chara karaka chang

m

of spiritual

V

Lesson #32
Compiled by Sourav Chowdhury
Topics Covered:
1. Puzzle: Male born on August 29, 1958, 11:44 P.M. (5 Hrs West
of GMT), Gary, Indiana, USA (87W20’47”, 41N35’36”). [Please
note the time zone is 5 hrs west and not 6 hrs west as given in
the Jagannatha Hora]. Find from the D-10 his likely career.
2. Narayana Dasa analysis of the Puzzle Chart.
3. Introduction to Narayana Dasa for Divisional Charts. D-10 of the
Puzzle Data analyzed.
4. Example Chart 2: Male born on September 16, 1961, 2:22 P.M.
(5.5 hrs East of GMT), Secundrabad, India (78E30’, 17N27’). D24 Narayana Dasa analyzed with focus on occult knowledge.
5. Example Chart 3: August 31, 1965, 2:09:27 A.M. (5.5 hrs East of
GMT), Kakinada, India (82E13’ 16N56’)
6. Example Chart 4: February 25, 1963, 8:45:29 P.M. (5.5 hrs East
of GMT), Nellore, India (79E58’ , 14N26’)
7. Discussion about utility of astrology and how it should be applied
for remedial measures.
Key Points:
1. Question: Does there have to be Ra/Ke in the 9H for foreign trip
to happen during the period of the Narayana Dasa of the 9H
sign?
Ans: Not necessarily. The involvement of 9H or 12H and
their lords with Ra/Ke is suffice. Ra is the karaka for the project of
foreign travel. The house, say 9H, represents the project, the planet
in the 9H represents the persons working in the project, the 9th lord is
the manager of these persons. If the karaka (Ra) has sufficient
control, or if the karaka is a good friend of the people-manager, then
the project will be done successfully. This is true in Rasi and also in
D-4.
Puzzle Chart:
2. In D-10, 10H (Career) is empty. 10L Ve is weak being with
enemy Ju, but forms Raja yoga as Ju is 5L. LL Su is in 5H
(Abilities, Recognition). Overall, a successful person.
3. 6H has exalted Ma – service-type career likely. A10 (formal
career) is in the 7H (desire) – business is also possible. But
career is indicated by the strongest amongst the 2H, 6H and
10H. 10H is strongest being aspected by its lord Ve which is in`,

`Topics Covered:
1. Three-parts-rule to judge Narayana Dasa of Rasi Chart
2. Example Chart 1: Guru P. V. R. Narasimha Rao, April 4, 1970,
5:47:13 p.m. (+5.5 hrs East of GMT), Machilipatnam, India (81E08,
16N10)
Key Points:
Example Chart 1 and explanation of Rule
1. Ar is the present Narayana Dasa of the Rasi Chart. Ar is in 8H.
Hence, during this dasa, 8H results can be given. Lord of Ar is
Ma which is 3L as well. Hence, during this dasa, 3H results can
also be given. Lord of Ar is 8H, hence in this case 8H results (i.e.
the result of the house containing the Dasa Lord) again may also
be given. If there are planets, which are aspecting the Dasa rasi,
they can also give their results during the period. Hence, several
results are possible in Ar dasa itself.
2. Also for example, if Le is the running dasa, then 12H results can
be given as Le is in the 12H. Additional results that are possible
are: 10H (as Le is 10th from AL), 7H (as its Lord Su is in 7H),
result of Ke, result of 3H (as 3L is Ke), results of Ju, Ve, Ma, Me
and Sa (as they aspect Le by rasi drishti). Thus again a number
of results can occur in Le dasa. There are clear rules to find out
which result is experienced in which part of the dasa.
3. To prove the point further, Cn is the second dasa and is in the
11H. Hence during this dasa, there could have been gains. As
11L Mo is aspecting it by rasi drishti, there may be some gains
related to food business or nursing business (Mo significations).
Again, Mo is in the 6H of enmity and also afflicted by Ra. Hence
some enmity may also be experienced. Whether the enmity is
related to gains is a different issue, but the fact that there is a
possibility of enmity is clear. Suppose, the 4 L or 7L Ju is placed
in Cn, there could be gain related to 4H and 7H (home/car/wife
etc) or relationship with the spouse may be harmonious (as Ju in
Cn would be exalted).
4. Parasara defined some signs as Sirshodaya Rasis (Sirsha or
head + udaya or rising), some as Prishtodaya Rasis and the rest
as Ubhayodaya Rasis.
